STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Once upon a time there was a lovely 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING princess. But she had an enchantment 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING upon her of a fearful sort which could 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING only be broken by love's first kiss. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING She was locked away in a castle guarded 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING by a terrible fire-breathing dragon. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Many brave knights had attempted to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING free her from this dreadful prison, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING but non prevailed. She waited in the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING dragon's keep in the highest room of 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the tallest tower for her true love 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and true love's first kiss. (laughs)

DELAY 1

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING after the ogre.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING NIGHT - NEAR SHREK'S HOME
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MAN1
DELAY 1

STRING Think it's in there?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MAN2
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right. Let's get it!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MAN1
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Whoa. Hold on. Do you know what that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING thing can do to you?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MAN3
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yeah, it'll grind your bones for it's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING bread.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek sneaks up behind them and laughs.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yes, well, actually, that would be a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING giant. Now, ogres, oh they're much worse. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They'll make a suit from your freshly 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING peeled skin.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They'll shave your liver. Squeeze the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING jelly from your eyes! Actually, it's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING quite good on toast.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MAN1
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Back! Back, beast! Back! I warn ya! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (waves the torch at Shrek.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek calmly licks his fingers and extinguishes the torch. The 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING men shrink back away from him. Shrek roars very loudly and long 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and his breath extinguishes all the remaining torches until the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING men are in the dark.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING This is the part where you run away. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (The men scramble to get away. He laughs.) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING And stay out! (looks down and picks 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING up a piece of paper. Reads.) "Wanted. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fairy tale creatures."(He sighs and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING throws the paper over his shoulder.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING THE NEXT DAY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING There is a line of fairy tale creatures. The head of the guard 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING sits at a table paying people for bringing the fairy tale creatures 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to him. There are cages all around. Some of the people in line 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING are Peter Pan, who is carrying Tinkerbell in a cage, Gipetto 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING who's carrying Pinocchio, and a farmer who is carrying the three 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING little pigs.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right. This one's full. Take it 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING away! Move it along. Come on! Get up!

ENTER	
STRING Next!

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (taking the witch's broom) Give me that! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Your flying days are over. (breaks the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING broom in half)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's 20 pieces of silver for the witch. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Next!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Get up! Come on!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Twenty pieces.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING LITTLE BEAR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (crying) This cage is too small.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Please, don't turn me in. I'll never 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING be stubborn again. I can change. Please! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Give me another chance!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING OLD WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, shut up. (jerks his rope)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Next! What have you got?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GIPETTO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING This little wooden puppet.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING PINOCCHIO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm not a puppet. I'm a real boy. (his 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING nose grows)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Five shillings for the possessed toy. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Take it away.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING PINOCCHIO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Father, please! Don't let them do this! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Help me!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Gipetto takes the money and walks off. The old woman steps up 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to the table.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Next! What have you got?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING OLD WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, I've got a talking donkey.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Right. Well, that's good for ten shillings, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING if you can prove it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING OLD WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, go ahead, little fella.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey just looks up at her.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING OLD WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, oh, he's just...he's just a little 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING nervous. He's really quite a chatterbox. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Talk, you boneheaded dolt...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's it. I've heard enough. Guards!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING OLD WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no, he talks! He does. (pretends 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to be Donkey) I can talk. I love to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING talk. I'm the talkingest damn thing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you ever saw.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Get her out of my sight.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING OLD WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no! I swear! Oh! He can talk!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The guards grab the old woman and she struggles with them. One 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of her legs flies out and kicks Tinkerbell out of Peter Pan's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING hands, and her cage drops on Donkey's head. He gets sprinkled 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with fairy dust and he's able to fly.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey! I can fly!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING PETER PAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He can fly!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING 3 LITTLE PIGS
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He can fly!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He can talk!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ha, ha! That's right, fool! Now I'm 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a flying, talking donkey. You might 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING have seen a housefly, maybe even a superfly 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING but I bet you ain't never seen a donkey 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING fly. Ha, ha! (the pixie dust begins 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to wear off) Uh-oh. (he begins to sink 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to the ground.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He hits the ground with a thud.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Seize him! (Donkey takes of running.) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING After him!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GUARDS
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He's getting away! Get him! This way! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Turn!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey keeps running and he eventually runs into Shrek. Literally. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek turns around to see who bumped into him. Donkey looks scared 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for a moment then he spots the guards coming up the path. He 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING quickly hides behind Shrek.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You there. Ogre!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Aye?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING By the order of Lord Farquaad I am authorized 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to place you both under arrest and transport 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you to a designated resettlement facility.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, really? You and what army?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He looks behind the guard and the guard turns to look as well 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and we see that the other men have run off. The guard tucks tail 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and runs off. Shrek laughs and goes back about his business and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING begins walking back to his cottage.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Can I say something to you? Listen, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you was really, really, really somethin' 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING back here. Incredible!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Are you talkin' to...(he turns around 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and Donkey is gone) me? (he turns back 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING around and Donkey is right in front 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of him.) Whoa!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yes. I was talkin' to you. Can I tell 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you that you that you was great back 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING here? Those guards! They thought they 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING was all of that. Then you showed up, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and bam! They was trippin' over themselves 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING like babes in the woods. That really 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING made me feel good to see that.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, that's great. Really.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Man, it's good to be free.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Now, why don't you go celebrate your 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING freedom with your own friends? Hmm?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But, uh, I don't have any friends. And 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm not goin' out there by myself. Hey, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING wait a minute! I got a great idea! I'll 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING stick with you. You're mean, green, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING fightin' machine. Together we'll scare 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the spit out of anybody that crosses 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING us.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek turns and regards Donkey for a moment before roaring very 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING loudly.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, wow! That was really scary. If you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING don't mind me sayin', if that don't 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING work, your breath certainly will get 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the job done, 'cause you definitely 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING need some Tic Tacs or something, 'cause 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you breath stinks! You almost burned 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the hair outta my nose, just like the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING time...(Shrek covers his mouth but Donkey 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING continues to talk, so Shrek removes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING his hand.) ...then I ate some rotten 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING berries. I had strong gases leaking 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING out of my butt that day.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Why are you following me?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'll tell you why. (singing) 'Cause 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm all alone, There's no one here beside 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING me, My problems have all gone, There's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING no one to deride me, But you gotta have 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING faith...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Stop singing! It's no wonder you don't 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING have any friends.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Wow. Only a true friend would be that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING cruelly honest.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Listen, little donkey. Take a look at 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING me. What am I?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (looks all the way up at Shrek) Uh ...really 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING tall?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No! I'm an ogre! You know. "Grab your 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING torch and pitchforks." Doesn't that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING bother you?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Nope.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Really?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Really, really.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Man, I like you. What's you name?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, Shrek.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek? Well, you know what I like about 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you, Shrek? You got that kind of I-don't-care-what-nobody-thinks-of-me 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING thing. I like that. I respect that, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek. You all right. (They come over 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a hill and you can see Shrek's cottage.) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Whoa! Look at that. Who'd want to live 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING in place like that?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That would be my home.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh! And it is lovely! Just beautiful. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know you are quite a decorator. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It's amazing what you've done with such 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a modest budget. I like that boulder. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That is a nice boulder. I guess you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING don't entertain much, do you?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I like my privacy.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know, I do too. That's another thing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING we have in common. Like I hate it when 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you got somebody in your face. You've 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING trying to give them a hint, and they 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING won't leave. There's that awkward silence. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (awkward silence) Can I stay with you?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, what?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Can I stay with you, please?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (sarcastically) Of course!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Really?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Please! I don't wanna go back there! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You don't know what it's like to be 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING considered a freak. (pause while he 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING looks at Shrek) Well, maybe you do. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But that's why we gotta stick together. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You gotta let me stay! Please! Please!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay! Okay! But one night only.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ah! Thank you! (he runs inside the cottage)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What are you...? (Donkey hops up onto 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a chair.) No! No!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING This is gonna be fun! We can stay up 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING late, swappin' manly stories, and in 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the mornin' I'm makin' waffles.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Where do, uh, I sleep?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (irritated) Outside!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, well, I guess that's cool. I mean, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I don't know you, and you don't know 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING me, so I guess outside is best, you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING know. Here I go. Good night. (Shrek 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING slams the door.) (sigh) I mean, I do 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING like the outdoors. I'm a donkey. I was 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING born outside. I'll just be sitting by 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING myself outside, I guess, you know. By 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING myself, outside. I'm all alone...there's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING no one here beside me...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK'S COTTAGE - NIGHT
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek is getting ready for dinner. He sits himself down and lights 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a candle made out of earwax. He begins to eat when he hears a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING noise. He stands up with a huff.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (to Donkey) I thought I told you to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING stay outside.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (from the window) I am outside.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING There is another noise and Shrek turns to find the person that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING made the noise. He sees several shadows moving. He finally turns 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and spots 3 blind mice on his table.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING BLIND MOUSE1
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, gents, it's a far cry from the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING farm, but what choice do we have?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING BLIND MOUSE2
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It's not home, but it'll do just fine.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GORDO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (bouncing on a slug) What a lovely bed.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Got ya. (Grabs a mouse, but it escapes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and lands on his shoulder.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GORDO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I found some cheese. (bites Shrek's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ear)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ow!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GORDO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Blah! Awful stuff.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING BLIND MOUSE1
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Is that you, Gordo?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GORDO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING How did you know?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Enough! (he grabs the 3 mice) What are 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you doing in my house? (He gets bumped 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from behind and he drops the mice.) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey! (he turns and sees the Seven Dwarves 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with Snow White on the table.) Oh, no, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING no, no. Dead broad off the table.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DWARF
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Where are we supposed to put her? The 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING bed's taken.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Huh?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek marches over to the bedroom and throws back the curtain. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The Big Bad Wolf is sitting in the bed. The wolf just looks at 
DELAY 1

STRING BIG BAD WOLF
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING TIME LAPSE
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek now has the Big Bad Wolf by the collar and is dragging 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING him to the front door.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I live in a swamp. I put up signs. I'm 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a terrifying ogre! What do I have to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING do get a little privacy? (He opens the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING front door to throw the Wolf out and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING he sees that all the collected Fairy 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Tale Creatures are on his land.) Oh, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING no. No! No!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The 3 bears sit around the fire, the pied piper is playing his 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING pipe and the rats are all running to him, some elves are directing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING flight traffic so that the fairies and witches can land...etc.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What are you doing in my swamp? (this 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING echoes and everyone falls silent.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Gasps are heard all around. The 3 good fairies hide inside a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING tent.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right, get out of here. All of you, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING move it! Come on! Let's go! Hapaya! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hapaya! Hey! Quickly. Come on! (more 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING dwarves run inside the house) No, no! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no. Not there. Not there. (they 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING shut the door on him) Oh! (turns to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING look at Donkey)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, don't look at me. I didn't invite 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING them.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING PINOCCHIO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, gosh, no one invited us.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING PINOCCHIO
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING We were forced to come here.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (flabbergasted) By who?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING LITTLE PIG
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Lord Farquaad. He huffed and he puffed 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and he...signed an eviction notice.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (heavy sigh) All right. Who knows where 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING this Farquaad guy is?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Everyone looks around at each other but no one answers.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, I do. I know where he is.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Does anyone else know where to find 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING him? Anyone at all?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Me! Me!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Anyone?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh! Oh, pick me! Oh, I know! I know! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Me, me!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (sigh) Okay, fine. Attention, all fairy 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING tale things. Do not get comfortable. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Your welcome is officially worn out. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING In fact, I'm gonna see this guy Farquaad 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING right now and get you all off my land 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and back where you came from! (Pause. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Then the crowd goes wild.) Oh! (to Donkey) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You! You're comin' with me.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right, that's what I like to hear, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING man. Shrek and Donkey, two stalwart 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING friends, off on a whirlwind big-city 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING adventure. I love it!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (singing) On the road again. Sing it 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with me, Shrek. I can't wait to get 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING on the road again.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What did I say about singing?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Can I whistle?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Can I hum it?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right, hum it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey begins to hum 'On the Road Again'.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DULOC - KITCHEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING A masked man is torturing the Gingerbread Man. He's continually 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING dunking him in a glass of milk. Lord Farquaad walks in.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's enough. He's ready to talk.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The Gingerbread Man is pulled out of the milk and slammed down 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING onto a cookie sheet. Farquaad laughs as he walks over to the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING table. However when he reaches the table we see that it goes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING up to his eyes. He clears his throat and the table is lowered.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (he picks up the Gingerbread Man's legs 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and plays with them) Run, run, run, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING as fast as you can. You can't catch 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING me. I'm the gingerbread man.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You are a monster.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm not the monster here. You are. You 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and the rest of that fairy tale trash, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING poisoning my perfect world. Now, tell 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING me! Where are the others?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Eat me! (He spits milk into Farquaad's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING eye.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I've tried to be fair to you creatures. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Now my patience has reached its end! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Tell me or I'll...(he makes as if to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING pull off the Gingerbread Man's buttons)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no, not the buttons. Not my gumdrop 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING buttons.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right then. Who's hiding them?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, I'll tell you. Do you know the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING muffin man?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The muffin man?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The muffin man.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yes, I know the muffin man, who lives 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING on Drury Lane?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, she's married to the muffin man.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The muffin man?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The muffin man!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING She's married to the muffin man.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The door opens and the Head Guard walks in.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING My lord! We found it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Then what are you waiting for? Bring 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING it in.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING More guards enter carrying something that is covered by a sheet. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They hang up whatever it is and remove the sheet. It is the Magic 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Mirror.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (in awe) Ohhhh...
DELAY 1

STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Magic mirror...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GINGERBREAD MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Don't tell him anything! (Farquaad picks 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING him up and dumps him into a trash can 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with a lid.) No!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Evening. Mirror, mirror on the wall. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Is this not the most perfect kingdom 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of them all?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, technically you're not a king.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, Thelonius. (Thelonius holds up a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING hand mirror and smashes it with his 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING fist.) You were saying?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What I mean is you're not a king yet. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But you can become one. All you have 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to do is marry a princess.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Go on.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (chuckles nervously) So, just sit back 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and relax, my lord, because it's time 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for you to meet today's eligible bachelorettes. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING And here they are! Bachelorette number 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING one is a mentally abused shut-in from 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a kingdom far, far away. She likes sushi 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and hot tubbing anytime. Her hobbies 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING include cooking and cleaning for her 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING two evil sisters. Please welcome Cinderella. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (shows picture of Cinderella) Bachelorette 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING number two is a cape-wearing girl from 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the land of fancy. Although she lives 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with seven other men, she's not easy. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Just kiss her dead, frozen lips and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING find out what a live wire she is. Come 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING on. Give it up for Snow White! (shows 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING picture of Snow White) And last, but 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING certainly not last, bachelorette number 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING three is a fiery redhead from a dragon-guarded 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING castle surrounded by hot boiling lava! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But don't let that cool you off. She's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a loaded pistol who likes pina colads 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and getting caught in the rain. Yours 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for the rescuing, Princess Fiona! (Shows 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING picture of Princess Fiona) So will it 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING be bachelorette number one, bachelorette 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING number two or bachelorette number three?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING GUARDS
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Two! Two! Three! Three! Two! Two! Three!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Three? One? Three?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING THELONIUS
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Three! (holds up 2 fingers) Pick number 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING three, my lord!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, okay, uh, number three!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Lord Farquaad, you've chosen Princess 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fiona.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Princess Fiona. She's perfect. All I 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING have to do is just find someone who 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING can go...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But I probably should mention the little 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING thing that happens at night.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'll do it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yes, but after sunset...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Silence! I will make this Princess Fiona 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING my queen, and DuLoc will finally have 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the perfect king! Captain, assemble 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING your finest men. We're going to have 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a tournament. (smiles evilly)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DuLoc Parking Lot - Lancelot Section
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek and Donkey come out of the field that is right by the parking 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING lot. The castle itself is about 40 stories high.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But that's it. That's it right there. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's DuLoc. I told ya I'd find it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING So, that must be Lord Farquaad's castle.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh-huh. That's the place.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Do you think maybe he's compensating 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for something? (He laughs, but then 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING groans as Donkey doesn't get the joke. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He continues walking through the parking 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING lot.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, wait. Wait up, Shrek.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hurry, darling. We're late. Hurry.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, you! (The attendant, who is wearing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a giant head that looks like Lord Farquaad, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING screams and begins running through the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING rows of rope to get to the front gate 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to get away from Shrek.) Wait a second. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Look, I'm not gonna eat you. I just 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING - - I just - - (He sighs and then begins 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING walking straight through the rows. The 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING attendant runs into a wall and falls 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING down. Shrek and Donkey look at him then 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING continue on into DuLoc.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DULOC
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They look around but all is quiet.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It's quiet. Too quiet. Where is everybody?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, look at this!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey runs over and pulls a lever that is attached to a box 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING marked 'Information'. The music winds up and then the box doors 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING open up. There are little wooden people inside and they begin 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to sing.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING WOODEN PEOPLE
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Welcome to DuLoc such a perfect town
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Here we have some rules
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Let us lay them down
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Don't make waves, stay in line
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING And we'll get along fine
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DuLoc is perfect place
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Please keep off of the grass
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shine your shoes, wipe your... face
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DuLoc is, DuLoc is
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DuLoc is perfect place.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Suddenly a camera takes Donkey and Shrek's picture.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Wow! Let's do that again! (makes ready 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to run over and pull the lever again)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (grabs Donkey's tail and holds him still) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No. No. No, no, no! No.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They hear a trumpet fanfare and head over to the arena.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Brave knights. You are the best and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING brightest in all the land. Today one 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of you shall prove himself...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING As Shrek and Donkey walk down the tunnel to get into the arena 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey is humming the DuLoc theme song.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING All right. You're going the right way 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for a smacked bottom.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Sorry about that.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That champion shall have the honor - 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING - no, no - - the privilege to go forth 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and rescue the lovely Princess Fiona 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from the fiery keep of the dragon. If 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for any reason the winner is unsuccessful, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the first runner-up will take his place 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and so on and so forth. Some of you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING may die, but it's a sacrifice I am willing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to make. (cheers) Let the tournament 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING begin! (He notices Shrek) Oh! What is 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING that? It's hideous!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (turns to look at Donkey and then back 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING at Farquaad) Ah, that's not very nice. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It's just a donkey.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Indeed. Knights, new plan! The one who 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING kills the ogre will be named champion! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Have it him!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Get him!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, hey! Now come on! Hang on now. (bumps 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING into a table where there are mugs of 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING beer)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING CROWD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Go ahead! Get him!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (holds up a mug of beer) Can't we just 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING settle this over a pint?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING CROWD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Kill the beast!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No? All right then. (drinks the beer) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Come on!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He takes the mug and smashes the spigot off the large barrel 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of beer behind him. The beer comes rushing out drenching the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING other men and wetting the ground. It's like mud now. Shrek slides 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING past the men and picks up a spear that one of the men dropped. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING As Shrek begins to fight Donkey hops up onto one of the larger 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING beer barrels. It breaks free of it's ropes and begins to roll. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey manages to squish two men into the mud. There is so much 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING fighting going on here I'm not going to go into detail. Suffice 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to say that Shrek kicks butt.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, Shrek, tag me! Tag me!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek comes over and bangs a man's head up against Donkeys. Shrek 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING gets up on the ropes and interacts with the crowd.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yeah!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING A man tries to sneak up behind Shrek, but Shrek turns in time 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and sees him.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING WOMAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The chair! Give him the chair!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek smashes a chair over the guys back. Finally all the men 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING are down. Donkey kicks one of them in the helmet, and the ding 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING sounds the end of the match. The audience goes wild.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, yeah! Ah! Ah! Thank you! Thank you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING very much! I'm here till Thursday. Try 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the veal! Ha, ha! (laughs)
DELAY 1

STRING The laughter stops as all of the guards turn their weapons on

STRING Shrek.

ENTER	
STRING HEAD GUARD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shall I give the order, sir?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, I have a better idea. People of

ENTER	
STRING DuLoc, I give you our champion!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What?

DELAY 1

ENTER	
STRING heading away from DuLoc. Shrek is munching on an onion.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a swamp which you only don't have because 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING he filled it full of freaks in the first

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

STRING You know, maybe there's a good reason 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING donkeys shouldn't talk.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I don't get it. Why don't you just pull

ENTER	
STRING him, lay siege to his fortress, grinds 
DELAY 1

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ogre trip.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING their heads on a pike, gotten a knife, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

DELAY 1 	
ENTER

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY

ENTER	
STRING (trailing after Shrek) Oh, you both

ENTER	
STRING have layers. Oh. {Sniffs} You know,

STRING loves cakes! Cakes have layers.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I don't care... what everyone likes. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ogres are not like cakes.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know what else everybody likes? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Parfaits. Have you ever met a person,

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Do you have a tissue or something? I'm 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING making a mess. Just the word parfait

STRING make me start slobbering.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They head off. There is a montage of their journey. Walking through 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a field at sunset. Sleeping beneath a bright moon. Shrek trying 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to put the campfire out the next day and having a bit of a problem, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING so Donkey pees on the fire to put it out.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DRAGON'S KEEP
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek and Donkey are walking up to the keep that's supposed to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING house Princess Fiona. It appears to look like a giant volcano.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (sniffs) Ohh! Shrek! Did you do that? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You gotta warn somebody before you just 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING crack one off. My mouth was open and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING everything.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Believe me, Donkey, if it was me, you'd 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING be dead. (sniffs) It's brimstone. We 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING must be getting close.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yeah, right, brimstone. Don't be talking 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING about it's the brimstone. I know what 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I smell. It wasn't no brimstone. It 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING didn't come off no stone neither.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They climb up the side of the volcano/keep and look down. There 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING is a small piece of rock right in the center and that is where 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the castle is. It is surrounded by boiling lava. It looks very 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING foreboding.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Sure, it's big enough, but look at the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING location. (laughs...then the laugh turns 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING into a groan)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, Shrek? Uh, remember when you said 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ogres have layers?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, aye.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, I have a bit of a confession to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING make. Donkeys don't have layers. We 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING wear our fear right out there on our 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING sleeves.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Wait a second. Donkeys don't have sleeves.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know what I mean.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You can't tell me you're afraid of heights.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, I'm just a little uncomfortable 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING about being on a rickety bridge over 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a boiling like of lava!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Come on, Donkey. I'm right here beside 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ya, okay? For emotional support., we'll 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING just tackle this thing together one 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING little baby step at a time.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Really?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Really, really.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, that makes me feel so much better.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Just keep moving. And don't look down.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, don't look down. Don't look down. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Don't look down. Keep on moving. Don't 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING look down. (he steps through a rotting 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING board and ends up looking straight down 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING into the lava) Shrek! I'm lookin' down! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, God, I can't do this! Just let me 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING off, please!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But you're already halfway.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But I know that half is safe!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, fine. I don't have time for this. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You go back.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek, no! Wait!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Just, Donkey - - Let's have a dance 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING then, shall me? (bounces and sways the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING bridge)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Don't do that!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, I'm sorry. Do what? Oh, this? (bounces

ENTER	
STRING Yes? Yes, do it. Okay. (continues to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING bounce and sway as he backs Donkey across 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the bridge)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, Shrek! No! Stop it!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You said do it! I'm doin' it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm gonna die. I'm gonna die. Shrek, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm gonna die. (steps onto solid ground) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That'll do, Donkey. That'll do. (walks 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING towards the castle)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Cool. So where is this fire-breathing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING pain-in-the-neck anyway?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Inside, waiting for us to rescue her. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (chuckles)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I was talkin' about the dragon, Shrek.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING INSIDE THE CASTLE
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

STRING Shh.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, good. Me neither. (sees a skeleton 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and gasps) 'Cause there's nothin' wrong 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with bein' afraid. Fear's a sensible 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING response to an unfamiliar situation. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Unfamiliar dangerous situation, I might 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING add. With a dragon that breathes fire 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and eats knights and breathes fire, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING it sure doesn't mean you're a coward 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING if you're a little scared. I sure as 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING heck ain't no coward. I know that.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey, two things, okay? Shut ... up. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Now go over there and see if you can 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING find any stairs.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Stairs? I thought we was lookin' for 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the princess.
DELAY 1

STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (putting on a helmet) The princess will 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING be up the stairs in the highest room 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING in the tallest tower.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What makes you think she'll be there?
DELAY 1

STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I read it in a book once. (walks off)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Cool. You handle the dragon. I'll handle 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the stairs. I'll find those stairs. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'll whip their butt too. Those stairs 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING won't know which way they're goin'. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (walks off)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING EMPTY ROOM
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey is still talking to himself as he looks around the room.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm gonna take drastic steps. Kick it 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to the curb. Don't mess with me. I'm 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the stair master. I've mastered the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING stairs. I wish I had a step right here. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'd step all over it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ELSEWHERE
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek spots a light in the tallest tower window.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, at least we know where the princess 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING is, but where's the...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (os) Dragon!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey gasps and takes off running as the dragon roars again. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek manages to grab Donkey out of the way just as the dragon 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING breathes fire.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey, look out! (he manages to get 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a hold of the dragons tail and holds 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING on) Got ya!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The dragon gets irritated at this and flicks it's tail and Shrek 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING goes flying through the air and crashes through the roof of the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING tallest tower. Fiona wakes up with a jerk and looks at him lying 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING on the floor.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh! Aah! Aah!

STRING part of the bridge he's on.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No. Oh, no, No! (the dragon roars) Oh, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING what large teeth you have. (the dragon 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING growls) I mean white, sparkling teeth. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I know you probably hear this all time 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from your food, but you must bleach, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING 'cause that is one dazzling smile you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING got there. Do I detect a hint of minty 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING freshness? And you know what else? You're 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING - - You're a girl dragon! Oh, sure! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I mean, of course you're a girl dragon. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You're just reeking of feminine beauty. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (the dragon begins fluttering her eyes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING at him) What's the matter with you? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You got something in your eye? Ohh. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh. Oh. Man, I'd really love to stay, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING but you know, I'm, uh...(the dragon 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING blows a smoke ring in the shape of a

ENTER	
STRING heart right at him, and he coughs) I'm 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING an asthmatic, and I don't know if it'd 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING work out if you're gonna blow smoke 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING rings. Shrek! (the dragon picks him 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING up with her teeth and carries him off) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No! Shrek! Shrek! Shrek!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA'S ROOM
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek groans as he gets up off the floor. His back is to Fiona 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING so she straightens her dress and lays back down on the bed. She 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING then quickly reaches over and gets the bouquet of flowers off 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the side table. She then lays back down and appears to be asleep. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek turns and goes over to her. He looks down at Fiona for 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a moment and she puckers her lips. Shrek takes her by the shoulders 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and shakes her away.

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But wait, Sir Knight. This be-ith our

ENTER	
STRING romantic moment?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yeah, sorry, lady. There's no time.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, wait. What are you doing? You should

ENTER	
STRING sweep me off my feet out yonder window 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and down a rope onto your valiant steed.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

STRING haven't you?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (smiles) Mm-hmm.
DELAY 1

ENTER	
STRING the hallway.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But we have to savor this moment! You 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

ENTER	
STRING ballad? A sonnet! A limerick? Or something!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I don't think so.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

STRING Uh, Shrek.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Sir Shrek. (clears throat and holds

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK

STRING (takes off running and drags Fiona behind 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING him.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But this isn't right! You were meant

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's what all the other knights did.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ignores her and heads for a wooden door 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING off to the side.) Wait. Where are you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING going? The exit's over there.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, I have to save my ass.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What kind of knight are you?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING One of a kind. (opens the door into 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the throne room)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (os) Slow down. Slow down, baby, please. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I believe it's healthy to get to know 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING someone over a long period of time. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Just call me old-fashioned. (laughs 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING worriedly) (we see him up close and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from a distance as Shrek sneaks into 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the room) I don't want to rush into 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a physical relationship. I'm not emotionally 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ready for a commitment of, uh, this 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING - - Magnitude really is the word I'm 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING looking for. Magnitude- - Hey, that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING is unwanted physical contact. Hey, what 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING are you doing? Okay, okay. Let's just 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING back up a little and take this one step 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING at a time. We really should get to know 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING each other first as friends or pen pals. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm on the road a lot, but I just love 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING receiving cards - - I'd really love 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to stay, but - - Don't do that! That's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING my tail! That's my personal tail. You're 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING gonna tear it off. I don't give permission 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING #¿NOMBRE?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, now. No way. No! No! No, no! No. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no, no. No! Oh!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek grabs a chain that's connected to the chandelier and swings 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING toward the dragon. He misses and he swings back again. He looks 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING up and spots that the chandelier is right above the dragons head. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He pulls on the chain and it releases and he falls down and bumps 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey out of the way right as the dragon is about to kiss him. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Instead the dragon kisses Shreks' butt. She opens her eyes and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING roars. Shrek lets go of the chain and the chandelier falls onto 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING her head, but it's too big and it goes over her head and forms 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a sort of collar for her. She roars again and Shrek and Donkey 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING take off running. Very 'Matrix' style. Shrek grabs Donkey and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING then grabs Princess Fiona as he runs past her.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hi, Princess!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It talks!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yeah, it's getting him to shut up that's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the trick.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They all start screaming as the dragon gains on them. Shrek spots 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a descending slide and jumps on. But unfortunately there is a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING crack in the stone and it hits Shrek right in the groin. His 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING eyes cross and as he reaches the bottom of the slide he stumbles 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING off and walks lightly.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek gets them close to the exit and sets down Donkey and Fiona.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, you two, heard for the exit! I'll 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING take care of the dragon.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek grabs a sword and heads back toward the interior of the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING castle. He throws the sword down in between several overlapping 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING chain links. The chain links are attached to the chandelier that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING is still around the dragons neck.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (echoing) Run!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They all take off running for the exit with the dragon in hot 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING pursuit. They make it to the bridge and head across. The dragons 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING breathes fire and the bridge begins to burn. They all hang on 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING for dear life as the ropes holding the bridge up collapse. They 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING are swung to the other side. As they hang upside down they look 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING in horror as the dragon makes to fly over the boiling lava to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING get them. But suddenly the chandelier with the chain jerk the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING dragon back and she's unable to get to them. Our gang climbs 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING quickly to safety as the dragon looks angry and then gives a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING sad whimper as she watches Donkey walk away.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (sliding down the 'volcano' hill) You 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING did it! You rescued me! You're amazing. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (behind her Donkey falls down the hill) 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You're - - You're wonderful. You're... 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (turns and sees Shrek fall down the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING hill and bump into Donkey) a little 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING unorthodox I'll admit. But thy deed 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING is great, and thy heart is pure. I am 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING eternally in your debt. (Donkey clears 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING his throat.) And where would a brave 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING knight be without his noble steed?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I hope you heard that. She called me 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a noble steed. She think I'm a steed.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The battle is won. You may remove your 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING helmet, good Sir Knight.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, no.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Why not?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I have helmet hair.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Please. I would'st look upon the face 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of my rescuer.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no, you wouldn't - - 'st.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But how will you kiss me?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What? (to Donkey) That wasn't in the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING job description.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Maybe it's a perk.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, it's destiny. Oh, you must know 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING how it goes. A princess locked in a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING tower and beset by a dragon is rescued 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING by a brave knight, and then they share 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING true love's first kiss.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hmm? With Shrek? You think- - Wait. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Wait. You think that Shrek is you true 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING love?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, yes.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Both Donkey and Shrek burst out laughing.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You think Shrek is your true love!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What is so funny?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Let's just say I'm not your type, okay?Fiona: 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Of course, you are. You're my rescuer. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Now - - Now remove your helmet.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Look. I really don't think this is a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING good idea.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Just take off the helmet.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm not going to.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Take it off.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Now!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay! Easy. As you command. Your Highness. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (takes off his helmet)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You- - You're a- - an ogre.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, you were expecting Prince Charming.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, yes, actually. Oh, no. This is 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING all wrong. You're not supposed to be 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING an ogre.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Princess, I was sent to rescue you by 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Lord Farquaad, okay? He is the one who 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING wants to marry you.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Then why didn't he come rescue me?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Good question. You should ask him that 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING when we get there.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But I have to be rescued by my true 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING love, not by some ogre and his- - his 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING pet.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, so much for noble steed.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You're not making my job any easier.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm sorry, but your job is not my problem. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You can tell Lord Farquaad that if he 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING wants to rescue me properly, I'll be 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING waiting for him right here.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey! I'm no one's messenger boy, all 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING right? (ominous) I'm a delivery boy. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (he swiftly picks her up and swings 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING her over his shoulder like she was a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING sack of potatoes)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You wouldn't dare. Put me down!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ya comin', Donkey?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'm right behind ya.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Put me down, or you will suffer the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING consequences! This is not dignified! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Put me down!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING WOODS
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING A little time has passed and Fiona has calmed down. She just 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING hangs there limply while Shrek carries her.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, so here's another question. Say 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING there's a woman that digs you, right, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING but you don't really like her that way. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING How do you let her down real easy so 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING her feelings aren't hurt, but you don't 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING get burned to a crisp and eaten?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You just tell her she's not your true 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING love. Everyone knows what happens when 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING you find your...(Shrek drops her on 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the ground) Hey! The sooner we get to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DuLoc the better.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You're gonna love it there, Princess. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It's beautiful!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING And what of my groom-to-be? Lord Farquaad? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What's he like?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Let me put it this way, Princess. Men 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of Farquaad's stature are in short supply. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (he and Donkey laugh)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek then proceeds to splash water onto his face to wash off 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the dust and grime.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I don't know. There are those who think 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING little of him. (they laugh again) Fiona: 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Stop it. Stop it, both of you. You're 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING just jealous you can never measure up 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to a great ruler like Lord Farquaad.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Yeah, well, maybe you're right, Princess. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But I'll let you do the "measuring" 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING when you see him tomorrow.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (looks at the setting sun) Tomorrow? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING It'll take that long? Shouldn't we stop 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to make camp?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, that'll take longer. We can keep 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING going.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But there's robbers in the woods.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Whoa! Time out, Shrek! Camp is starting 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to sound good.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey, come on. I'm scarier than anything 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING we're going to see in this forest.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I need to find somewhere to camp now!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Both Donkey and Shrek's ears lower as they shrink away from her.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MOUNTAIN CLIFF
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek has found a cave that appears to be in good order. He shoves 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a stone boulder out of the way to reveal the cave.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hey! Over here.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek, we can do better than that. I 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING don't think this is fit for a princess.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, no, it's perfect. It just needs 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a few homey touches.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Homey touches? Like what? (he hears 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a tearing noise and looks over at Fiona 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING who has torn the bark off of a tree.)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING A door? Well, gentlemen, I bid thee 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING good night. (goes into the cave and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING puts the bark door up behind her)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You want me to read you a bedtime story? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I will.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (os) I said good night!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek looks at Donkey for a second and then goes to move the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING boulder back in front of the entrance to the cave with Fiona 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING still inside.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek, What are you doing?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (laughs) I just- - You know - - Oh, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING come on. I was just kidding.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING LATER THAT NIGHT
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek and Donkey are sitting around a campfire. They are staring 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING up into the sky as Shrek points out certain star constellations 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to Donkey.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING And, uh, that one, that's Throwback, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the only ogre to ever spit over three 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING wheat fields.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Right. Yeah. Hey, can you tell my future 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from these stars?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The stars don't tell the future, Donkey. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They tell stories. Look, there's Bloodnut, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the Flatulent. You can guess what he's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING famous for.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I know you're making this up.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, look. There he is, and there's the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING group of hunters running away from his 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING stench.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That ain't nothin' but a bunch of little 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING dots.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know, Donkey, sometimes things are 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING more than they appear. Hmm? Forget it.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (heaves a big sigh) Hey, Shrek, what 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING we gonna do when we get our swamp anyway?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Our swamp?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know, when we're through rescuing 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the princess.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING We? Donkey, there's no "we". There's 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING no "our". There's just me and my swamp. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The first thing I'm gonna do is build 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a ten-foot wall around my land.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You cut me deep, Shrek. You cut me real 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING deep just now. You know what I think? 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I think this whole wall thing is just 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a way to keep somebody out.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, do ya think?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Are you hidin' something?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Never mind, Donkey.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, this is another one of those onion 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING things, isn't it?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING No, this is one of those drop-it and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING leave-it alone things.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Why don't you want to talk about it?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Why do you want to talk about it?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Why are you blocking?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, yes, you are.
DELAY 1

STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

STRING Donkey, I'm warning you.

STRING DONKEY

STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (pause) Oh, now we're gettin' somewhere. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (grins)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING At this point Fiona pulls the 'door' away from the entrance to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the cave and peaks out. Neither of the guys see her.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh! For the love of Pete! (gets up and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING walks over to the edge of the cliff 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and sits down)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What's your problem? What you got against 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING the whole world anyway?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Look, I'm not the one with the problem, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING okay? It's the world that seems to have 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a problem with me. People take one look 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING at me and go. "Aah! Help! Run! A big, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING stupid, ugly ogre!" They judge me before 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING they even know me. That's why I'm better 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING off alone.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know what? When we met, I didn't 
DELAY 1

STRING think you was just a big, stupid, ugly

STRING ogre.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1

DELAY 1

ENTER	
STRING and Annoying.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Okay, okay, I see it now. The big shiny

ENTER	
STRING one, right there. That one there?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fiona puts the door back.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's the moon.
DELAY 1

STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, okay.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DuLoc - Farquaad's Bedroom
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The camera pans over a lot of wedding stuff. Soft music plays 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING in the background. Farquaad is in bed, watching as the Magic 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Mirror shows him Princess Fiona.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Again, show me again. Mirror, mirror, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING show her to me. Show me the princess.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MIRROR
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Hmph.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The Mirror rewinds and begins to play again from the beginning.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FARQUAAD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ah. Perfect.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Farquaad looks down at his bare chest and pulls the sheet up 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to cover himself as though Fiona could see him as he gazes sheepishly 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING at her image in the mirror.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MORNING
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fiona walks out of the cave. She glances at Shrek and Donkey 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING who are still sleeping. She wanders off into the woods and comes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING across a blue bird. She begins to sing. The bird sings along 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING with her. She hits higher and higher notes and the bird struggles 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to keep up with her. Suddenly the pressure of the note is too 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING big and the bird explodes. Fiona looks a little sheepish, but 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING she eyes the eggs that the bird left behind. Time lapse, Fiona 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING is now cooking the eggs for breakfast. Shrek and Donkey are still 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING sleeping. Shrek wakes up and looks at Fiona. Donkey's talking 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING in his sleep.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (quietly) Mmm, yeah, you know I like

DELAY 1 	
ENTER

ENTER	
STRING eggs?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, good morning, Princess!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fiona gets up and sets the eggs down in front of them.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What's all this about?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING You know, we kind of got off to a bad 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING start yesterday. I wanted to make it 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING up to you. I mean, after all, you did 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING rescue me.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, thanks.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Donkey sniffs the eggs and licks his lips.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, eat up. We've got a big day ahead 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of us. (walks off)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING LATER
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING They are once again on their way. They are walking through the 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING forest. Shrek belches.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What? It's a compliment. Better out

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, it's no way to behave in front 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING of a princess.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fiona belches
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Thanks.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING DONKEY
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING She's as nasty as you are.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (chuckles) You know, you're not exactly 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING what I expected.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Well, maybe you shouldn't judge people 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING before you get to know them.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING She smiles and then continues walking, singing softly. Suddenly 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from out of nowhere, a man swings down and swoops Fiona up into 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a tree.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING La liberte! Hey!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (to Robin Hood) What are you doing?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Be still, mon cherie, for I am you savior! 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING And I am rescuing you from this green...(kisses

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Please, monster! Can't you see I'm a 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING little busy here?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (getting fed up) Look, pal, I don't

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh! Of course! Oh, how rude. Please 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING let me introduce myself. Oh, Merry Men. 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING (laughs)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Suddenly an accordion begins to play and the Merry men pop out 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING from the bushes. They begin to sing Robin's theme song.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MERRY MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Ta, dah, dah, dah, whoo.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I steal from the rich and give to the

ENTER	
STRING MERRY MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He takes a wee percentage,
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING But I'm not greedy. I rescue pretty 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING damsels, man, I'm good.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MERRY MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What a guy, Monsieur Hood.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Break it down. I like an honest fight 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and a saucy little maid...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MERRY MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING What he's basically saying is he likes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING to get...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Paid. So...When an ogre in the bush 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING grabs a lady by the tush. That's bad.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MERRY MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING That's bad.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING When a beauty's with a beast it makes 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING me awfully mad.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MERRY MEN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING He's mad, he's really, really mad.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING ROBIN HOOD
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING I'll take my blade and ram it through 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING your heart, keep your eyes on me, boys 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING 'cause I'm about to start...
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING There is a grunt as Fiona swings down from the tree limb and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING knocks Robin Hood unconscious.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Man, that was annoying!
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Shrek looks at her in admiration.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING MERRY MAN
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Oh, you little- - (shoots an arrow at 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Fiona but she ducks out of the way)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING The arrow flies toward Donkey who jumps into Shrek's arms to 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING get out of the way. The arrow proceeds to just bounce off a tree.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Another fight sequence begins and Fiona gives a karate yell and 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING then proceeds to beat the crap out of the Merry Men. There is 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING a very interesting 'Matrix' moment here when Fiona pauses in 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING mid-air to fix her hair. Finally all of the Merry Men are down, 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING and Fiona begins walking away.
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Uh, shall we?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

STRING FIONA

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Where did you learn that?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
DELAY 1

STRING Well...(laughs) when one lives alone,

ENTER	
STRING uh, one has to learn these things in

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING SHREK

STRING What? (turns and looks) Oh, would you 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING look at that? (he goes to pull it out 
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING but flinches because it's tender)
DELAY 1 	
ENTER

DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING Does anyone know the Heimlich?
DELAY 1 	
ENTER	
STRING FIONA
